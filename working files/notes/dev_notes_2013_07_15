to test the current code:

on each host make a folder for some test files in ~
mkdir ~/zion_test

put something like this in your .fabricrc
zion_config_file = /full/path/to/this/src/zion/config/prod.json

workon zion_v_1
	switch to zion_v_1 environment in virtualenv
fab install --hosts=localhost,rancho.tinisi.com
	run the current script in fabfile folder/package
	(this most simple example assumed you have a user with same name as local on all hosts)

on each host this should result in:

cd ~/zion_test
ls -1
bind.install
dhcp.install
foreman.install
install
os.setup
puppet.install
user.create
	
an empty file for each method/action in each package
and the file install should have something like this:

host ip: 192.168.0.12
debug: False
