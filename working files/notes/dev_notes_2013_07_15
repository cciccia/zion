fab install --hosts=zion.tinisi.local -u tinisi

fab restart_services --hosts=zion.tinisi.local -u tinisi

# TODO

[ ] normalize permissions on moved files and templates, tinisi owns some stuff he shouldn't
[X] set up sudo with no password for wheel initially
[ ] add step at the end to change it to sudo with password
[ ] add setps at the end to put debug level back down from debug
[ ] get ntp working because when clock is wrong, DNS with keys doesn't work
[ ] get a handle on which services start when, at the end of everything they should all be started
[ ] thinking each package should have a "run_all()" method or something like that which is default
[X] add a method at the end to spit out the installed packages for logging
[X] changing sudoers file in a few other places, and not doing the check using visudo
[ ] these services might need chkconfig commands to make them stay up:
	libvirtd
	messagebus
	foreman-proxy
	foreman (I think puppet takes care of this)

Hah! Looks like I have enough RAM, had a loose memory stick!

output from engine set up

[root@zion ~]# engine-setup
Welcome to oVirt Engine setup utility

In order to proceed the installer must stop the ovirt-engine service
Would you like to stop the ovirt-engine service? (yes|no): yes
 oVirt Engine uses httpd to proxy requests to the application server.
It looks like the httpd installed locally is being actively used.
The installer can override current configuration .
Alternatively you can use JBoss directly (on ports higher than 1024)
Do you wish to override current httpd configuration and restart the service? ['yes'| 'no']  [yes] : no
HTTP Port  [8700] : 
HTTPS Port  [8701] : 
Host fully qualified domain name. Note: this name should be fully resolvable  [zion.tinisi.local] : 
zion.tinisi.local did not resolve into an IP address
User input failed validation, do you still wish to use it? (yes|no): no
Host fully qualified domain name. Note: this name should be fully resolvable  [zion.tinisi.local] : 
The IP 192.168.0.11 does not hold a PTR record for the FQDN: zion.tinisi.local
User input failed validation, do you still wish to use it? (yes|no): yes
Enter a password for an internal oVirt Engine administrator user (admin@internal) :
Warning: Weak Password.
Confirm password :
Organization Name for the Certificate  [tinisi.local] : Tinisi
The default storage type you will be using  ['NFS'| 'FC'| 'ISCSI'| 'POSIXFS']  [NFS] : 
Enter DB type for installation ['remote'| 'local']  [local] : 
Enter a password for a local oVirt Engine DB admin user (engine) :
Warning: Weak Password.
Confirm password :
Configure NFS share on this server to be used as an ISO Domain? ['yes'| 'no']  [yes] : 
Local ISO domain path  [/var/lib/exports/iso] : 
Firewall ports need to be opened.
The installer can configure iptables automatically overriding the current configuration. The old configuration will be backed up.
Alternately you can configure the firewall later using an example iptables file found under /etc/ovirt-engine/iptables.example
Configure iptables ? ['yes'| 'no']: yes

oVirt Engine will be installed using the following configuration:

http://emeraldreverie.org/blog/2012/10/26/creating-development-environment-with/

giving up for now, gonna wipe the machine and make sure the script works.

my ISP will be using ovirt instead of libvirt, and apparently I don't have enough RAM for ovirt.

need to pursue some hardware...fuck

[ ] This didn't make any difference
enabled tsl in qemu.conf

mkdir /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc
ln -s /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/zion.tinisi.local.pem /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc/server-cert.pem
ln -s /var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/zion.tinisi.local.pem /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc/server-key.pem
ln -s /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc/ca-cert.pem

NOPE!

# following instructions to make ssh keys for foreman user

(decided this is a dead end, NOT adding it to the script)

as root:
mkdir /usr/share/foreman/.ssh
chown foreman .ssh
chmod g=,o= .ssh
chgrp foreman .ssh

make ssh folder for root
put foreman key in authoriazed_keys
had to re-anable remote root log on

using this for address:
qemu+ssh://root@192.168.0.11/system

per Darrel:
service dnsmasq stop
chkconfig dnsmasq off

http://emeraldreverie.org/blog/2012/10/26/creating-development-environment-with/

trying his edit to the network in virsh, adding bootp

also used settings page and set Token_duration to 60 min

looks like restarting mesagebus helped

service messagebus restart

in the Foreman admin web interface:
* gave admin user ALL roles
* changed token timeout setting to 60 min

# 9/4/2013

[X] added these to the libvirtd config

key_file = "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/zion.tinisi.local.pem"
cert_file = "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/zion.tinisi.local.pem"
ca_file = "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem"

changed path to dhcpd.conf in proxy config!

http://itscblog.tamu.edu/startup-guide-for-kvm-on-centos-6/
(might just be able to restart?)

dbus-uuidgen > /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
service messagebus restart

now I can test the connection to the hypervisor!

smart proxy setup works, but DNS and DHCP are not showing up in list
mad a self signed certificate, not sure what that does ;-)

seems Foreman is talking to libvirt!!!!!
I can see drives being created in my storage pool and no errors when I save host
but DHCP auto suggest of addresses still not working
and after save of host, nothing is listed in host list and nothing built
could be at this point I just have wrong recipe of templates
time to rebuild from scratch and get a note off to db for instructions

tried to run installer again

echo include foreman_installer | puppet apply --modulepath /usr/share/foreman-installer

got loads of errors related to fqdn

edited puppet.conf, added server to match rancho

manually re-ran commands to shutoff iptables and set permissive ESLinux

then, named would start

error in apache
/etc/httpd/conf.d/foreman.conf
ServerName takes one argument, The hostname and port of the server

configs were all f'ed up, probably from re-install attempt, if more of this, time to start over

# 8/23/2013

flailing to get named working
already added the selinux and iptables stuff to the os script

any of these things might have to be added
    # chown root named.conf
    # chmod o=r named.iscdlv.key
    # chown named:named named.conf
    # chown named:named /etc/rndc.key
    # chmod 644 /etc/rndc.key


get ntp working

	ntpdate ntp.pool.org
	hwclock --systohc

rm /var/named/dynamic/managed-keys.bind*
service named restart

just setting the clock to be closer to correct got DNS forwards working with keys
look at adding proper ntp set up to system

# 7/27/2013

to test the current code:

on each host make a folder for some test files in ~
mkdir ~/zion_test

put something like this in your .fabricrc
zion_config_file = /full/path/to/this/src/zion/config/prod.json

workon zion_v_1
	switch to zion_v_1 environment in virtualenv
fab install --hosts=localhost,rancho.tinisi.com
	run the current script in fabfile folder/package
	(this most simple example assumed you have a user with same name as local on all hosts)

on each host this should result in:

cd ~/zion_test
ls -1
bind.install
dhcp.install
foreman.install
install
os.setup
puppet.install
user.create
	
an empty file for each method/action in each package
and the file install should have something like this:

host ip: 192.168.0.12
debug: False
