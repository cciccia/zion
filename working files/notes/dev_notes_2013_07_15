flailing to get named working
already added the selinux and iptables stuff to the os script

any of these things might have to be added
    # chown root named.conf
    # chmod o=r named.iscdlv.key
    # chown named:named named.conf
    # chown named:named /etc/rndc.key
    # chmod 644 /etc/rndc.key


get ntp working

	ntpdate ntp.pool.org
	hwclock --systohc

rm /var/named/dynamic/managed-keys.bind*
service named restart

just setting the clock to be closer to correct got DNS forwards working with keys
look at adding proper ntp set up to system

to test the current code:

on each host make a folder for some test files in ~
mkdir ~/zion_test

put something like this in your .fabricrc
zion_config_file = /full/path/to/this/src/zion/config/prod.json

workon zion_v_1
	switch to zion_v_1 environment in virtualenv
fab install --hosts=localhost,rancho.tinisi.com
	run the current script in fabfile folder/package
	(this most simple example assumed you have a user with same name as local on all hosts)

on each host this should result in:

cd ~/zion_test
ls -1
bind.install
dhcp.install
foreman.install
install
os.setup
puppet.install
user.create
	
an empty file for each method/action in each package
and the file install should have something like this:

host ip: 192.168.0.12
debug: False
