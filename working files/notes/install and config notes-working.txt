# manual steps

[X] instructions for minimal install CD with defaults

[ ] TODO: look for check box to make network "automatic" (changes DHCP to ONBOOT-yes)

# pre_install
	os.enable_sudo (as root)

[X] give wheel sudo
 	- copy sudo file to temp spot
	 - use fabric command to un-comment line in default file
	 - use visudo -q -c -s -f on new file to check it
	 - swap out the temp file

# pre_install
	os.add_users

[X] made user for tinisi
[X] put tinisi in wheel

# install
	os.ssh_lockdown

[X] change these from default in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	Port 22 <= this is actually the default
	Protocol 2 <= this is actually the default
	PermitRootLogin no
	UseDNS no

# install
    os.update

[X] sudo yum checkupdate
[X} sudo yum update
[X] yum list installed

# install
	os.add_repos

[X] rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
	this adds the EPEL repo to yum:
	http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F
[X] sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/6/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-6-6.noarch.rpm
	this adds puppet labs to yum repos from here:
	http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html

# install
    bind.install

[X] sudo yum install bind-utils
[X] sudo yum install bind-libs
[X] sudo yum install bind
[X] sudo yum install bind-chroot
[X] followed instructions here to set up chrooted dns
	* per http://sysadminpy.com/sysadmin/2012/04/05/setting-up-foreman-on-centosrhel-57-part-2/#foreman_dependencies
	# cd /var/named/chroot/etc
	# dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 128 -n HOST foreman

	# cat Kforeman.+157+51238.key
	foreman. IN KEY 512 3 157 [..key..]
	# cat Kforeman.+157+51238.private
	Private-key-format: v1.2
	Algorithm: 157 (HMAC_MD5)
	Key: [..key..]

	(use same as DHCP grep to pull out secret)

config notes:

build dns_admin_email from general admin_email replacing @ with .
generate foreman_dns_key
generate dns_hostname from full_domain_name (split on ., use first element)
generate reverse_ip_sub (split ip on ., drop last segment and reverse order, ie 0.168.192)
generate ip_sub (split ip on ., drop last segment, ie 192.168.0 )
generate dns_domain_name from full_domain_name (split on ., use all but first elements)

# install
    dhcp.install

[X] sudo yum install dhcp
[X] used pretty much the exact dhcpd.conf file as here:
	http://sysadminpy.com/sysadmin/2012/04/05/setting-up-foreman-on-centosrhel-57-part-2
[X] set up dhcpd.conf per this web site:
	http://www.krizna.com/centos/install-configure-dhcp-server-centos-6/

[X]] generated DHCP key
sudo dnssec-keygen -r /dev/urandom -a HMAC-MD5 -b 512 -n HOST omapi_key
sudo cat Komapi_key.+*.private |grep ^Key|cut -d ' ' -f2-
[..key..]
[X] chkconfig --levels 235 dhcpd on

# install
    puppet.install

# install
    foreman.install


(foreman dhcp related tasks)
[ ] added this to /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml
:dhcp_key_name: omapi_key
:dhcp_key_secret: [..key..]
[ ] now issue is proxy log says can't read dhcps conf or leases
[ ] usermod -a -G dhcpd foreman-proxy
[ ] made /etc/dhcp world readable and executable
chmod o=r dhcp
chmod o=rx ./dhcp

(foreman DNS relates tasks)
[ ] added foreman-proxy to the named group:
usermod -a -G named foreman-proxy
so that this test will pass:

This will configure Foreman, Foreman-Proxy, Puppet (including a puppetmaster),
several puppet environments, TFTP (for provisioning) and sudo (for puppet
certificate management)
